  <div class="publication-description">Project managers and developers don't always see eye-to-eye on what tools to use. So what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Something has to give. We have had to find a balance of keeping the project management happy, while simultaneously conforming to their documentation and time-management policies. We also have had to keep our development team on task and moving forward in a way that is most efficient for the project. In this paper, we discuss the techniques, tools, and methodologies we're using to stay on track, and the compromises we've had to make in order to keep as many people happy about the process as possible.</div>

  <div class="publication-description">As the threat of global warming comes out of the land of speculation and into the real world, the demand for accurate, repeatable climate science is growing at a tremendous pace. To help the ever-increasing number of researchers with their ballooning datasets, climate science tools need to improve in tandem. The current paradigm of passing terabytes of raw data over the network repeatedly and the wide variety of semi-compatible tools needs to be replaced. We are doing so with a single web application, able to handle the diverse needs and growing demands of the climate science world, following the same continuous delivery deployment model as SaaS businesses. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the ACME project are uniquely suited to fill this void in the scientist’s tool kit; we are at the crux of data providers’ networks, HPC infrastructure, researchers, and the developers building the tools. This paper will discuss the challenges faced by this effort and the prototype, which is currently in development.</div>

  <a class="publication-title" href="http://aims-group.github.io/pdf/Webengine_WCECS2014.pdf" target="_blank">Webengine</a>
  <div class="publication-description">Webengine is an ancient piece of Kryptonian technology designed to terraform an outdated website such that its style and content are aligned with newer websites. Keeping a website up-to-date, not only with content but also with styling, is what keeps users and customers coming back. They may not always be happy with these changes (look at Facebook), but the ability to quickly refresh your website is imperative to staying relevant. Two new Python scripts webengine.py and webshooter.py strives to do just that. The days of dynamically creating basic websites using php and mysql have passed. Powerful new tools such as Hyde and Jekyll are the keys to quick website creation today. With webshooter, a system administrator or even a project leader can create a new and fresh looking website with one of three different style options and then populate it with the data and content from the previous website by running webengine.</div>

  <a class="publication-title" href="media/pdf/strategic_roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">Department of Energy Strategic Roadmap for Earth System Science Data Integration</a>
  <div class="publication-description">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Climate and Environmental Sciences Division (CESD) produces a diversity of data, information, software, and model codes across its research and informatics programs and facilities. This information includes raw and reduced observational and instrumentation data, model codes, model-generated results, and integrated data products. Currently, most of these data and information are prepared and shared for program specific activities, corresponding to CESD organization research. A major challenge facing BER CESD is how best to inventory, integrate, and deliver these vast and diverse resources for the purpose of accelerating Earth system science research. This paper provides a concept for a CESD Integrated Data Ecosystem and an initial roadmap for its implementation to address this integration challenge in the “Big Data” domain.</div>

  <div class="publication-description">Increasingly large climate model simulations are enhancing our understanding of the processes and causes of anthropogenic climate change, thanks to very large public investments in high-performance computing at national and international institutions. Various climate models implement mathematical approximations of nature in different ways, which are often based on differing computational grids. These complex, parallelized coupled system codes combine numerous complex submodels (ocean, atmosphere, land, biosphere, sea ice, land ice, etc.) that represent components of the larger complex climate system.</div>

  <div class="publication-description">In this paper, we report on obstacles overcome and the key lessons learned in moving a small portion (10 TB) of the multimodel Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 3 data set used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report from three sources—the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)—to the 2009 Supercomputing conference (SC09) show floor in Portland, Oregon.</div>

  <div class="publication-description">The Supercomputing 2009 (SC09) Bandwidth Challenge entry titled, “High Performance GridFTP Transport of Earth System Grid (ESG) Data,” demonstrated high-performance GridFTP transport of climate data from multiple Department of Energy laboratories to the targeted SC09 showroom floor. The transferred multi-terabyte data consisted of a small portion of the multi-model Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 3 (CMIP-3) data set used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).</div>
